# Advanced Real-Time Fraud Detection System

## Overview
This project is designed to create an advanced real-time fraud detection system for financial services, leveraging AWS cloud services to ensure scalability, security, and performance. The system integrates machine learning, behavioral analysis, and real-time monitoring to identify and respond to fraudulent activities.

## Architecture
The system architecture leverages a variety of AWS services, as shown below:

### Key Components:
1. **Users**: Frontend users who interact with the system to view fraud detection insights and alerts.
2. **AWS API Gateway**: Manages and routes HTTP requests from users to backend services.
3. **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute layer that processes requests, interacts with other AWS services, and runs fraud detection algorithms.
4. **Amazon SageMaker**: Develops, trains, and deploys machine learning models to detect fraud.
5. **Amazon S3**: Stores transaction data, model artifacts, and related files.
6. **Amazon Kinesis**: Handles real-time data streaming for continuous monitoring.
7. **AWS Amplify**: Hosts the frontend application for user interaction.
8. **Amazon QuickSight**: Provides dashboards and visualizations for monitoring system performance.
9. **Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)**: Sends email alerts for suspicious activities.

## Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors transaction data for potential fraudulent activity.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Uses machine learning models developed in SageMaker to detect and predict fraudulent behavior.
- **Alert System**: Sends real-time alerts via email to administrators when suspicious activity is detected.
- **Scalable & Secure**: Built on AWS infrastructure, ensuring scalability and security.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- **AWS Account**: You'll need an AWS account with sufficient permissions to use the mentioned services.
- **AWS CLI**: Ensure you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with your AWS credentials.
- **Node.js**: Required for deploying the frontend with AWS Amplify.

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/fraud-detection-system.git
   cd fraud-detection-system
